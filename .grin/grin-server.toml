# Generated Server Configuration File for Grin
#
# When running the grin executable without specifying any command line
# arguments, it will look for this file in two places, in the following
# order:
#
# -The working directory
# -[user home]/.grin

#comment it to disable basic auth

#The chain type, which defines the genesis block and the set of cuckoo
#parameters used for mining as well as wallet output coinbase maturity. Can be:
#AutomatedTesting - For CI builds and instant blockchain creation
#UserTesting - For regular user testing (cuckoo 16)
#Testnet1 - Testnet1 genesis block (cuckoo 16)
#Testnet2 - Testnet2 genesis block (cuckoo 30)
#Testnet3 - Testnet3 genesis block (cuckoo 30)
#Testnet4 - Testnet4 genesis block (cuckatoo 29+)

#the chain validation mode, defines how often (if at all) we
#want to run a full chain validation. Can be:
#"EveryBlock" - run full chain validation when processing each block (except during sync)
#"Disabled" - disable full chain validation (just run regular block validation)

#will also disable logging to stdout

#usertesting) at cuckoo 16, and will only mine into the default wallet port.
